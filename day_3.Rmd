# GLM

The General Linear Model is a framework of models that function within the base concept of:

$$
Data = Model + Error
$$

As you will note this is similar to the Straight Line OLS model discussed earlier. In fact OLS is a type of GLM. But there are others, such as Logistic Regression, Possion Regression etc. This others allow you to accomplish feats such as fitting a curve line with what appears to be exponential growth in the continous dependent variable (Possion) or even work out probabilities with a binary categorical dependent variable (Probit, Logistic).
