## Notes for R and Stats Revision 2023


**By Jody Holland for class by Professor Fernando Tuya at the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. There may be typos, it may not always make sense, but hopefully it will be a useful reference resource in the future. The aim of this week for me is to brush up on my R and to push my skills of version control and webdesign in RStudio. I may also do some fun stuff with Python**
